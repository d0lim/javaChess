# javaChess

Repository for SW Project Chess Team Project

## Used Language & Toolkit
This project is written in Java and uses Swing as GUI toolkit.

## Notice
This project is not based on any pattern(MVC, Factory Pattern, etc...).
So, this code is not well engineered and structured.
And, because our team's 2vs2 chess argorithm is not perfect, 2vs2 chess will not work properly.
Even though, 1vs1 chess works great. (Even Performance is not good)
